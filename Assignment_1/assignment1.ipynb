        "Below we have provided an itemized list of nine common probability distributions. Your task is to sample from **five** of the distributions, one at a time, while visualizing the distributions by plotting the samples in a histogram. For each distribution, $q(x)$, state its **support** and whether it's a **continuous or discrete distribution**. To familiarize yourself with the distributions, first play around with the parameter settings, and then plot $q(x)$ for two different parameter settings using subplots.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to sample from $q(x)$, we recommend you to use `numpy` or `sklearn`. Draw 50k samples. The simplest way to plot the distributions is by using `matplotlib`. If you want to make the plots more fancy we recommend you to check out [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) or [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/python/). For visualization of the distributions using histograms, use ```bins=1000```.\n",
